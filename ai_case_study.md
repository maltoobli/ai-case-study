#### How does the company evaluate success?

for the product is How closely do the produced images resemble reality
and in general By increasing the number of users over time through Adobe Creative Suite and acquiring new subscribers to its services.

#### How are the products performing in the market, and what is the end users' point of view?

It's still the case that there were complaints about photorealism, as the creator compared images produced by competitors and found them to be superior. The images are still far from realistic


*Here is a real comparison between Adobe Firefly and its competitors, as provided by a content creator and influencer on Twitter (x.com)*



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got access to Adobe Firefly. The image generator is good, but not great, certainly when using photorealism. Compare it with Midjourney v5 (left); Firefly (right) feels much more like stock photography, less visually dramatic. <a href="https://t.co/W6lAtbKTIU">pic.twitter.com/W6lAtbKTIU</a></p>&mdash; Peter Gasston (@stopsatgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/stopsatgreen/status/1638853926903504898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Recommendations



Enhance accessibility to the public to facilitate the feedback process and generate more images in the beta version. Currently, the free version is restricted to 25 credits. Another improvement is to expand the library and acquire additional resources for the images.
